          acquaint gets out of the way and lets your friends who know you better help you find matches. We provide the software and tools to make that process seamless. It's also safer since every user has been vetted by their friends. No algorithms here to decide your next date.

          have that friend who is great but can't get a date since they are too picky? Blind date mode removes implicit bias that people may be instantly judged on. It can be turned off once 50 messages are exchanged, or both parties consent to it during the conversation.
